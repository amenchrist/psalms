        title:`FAITH, HOPE, AND LOVE!`,
        body:`(Three Principles To Live By)
        
        TO THE BIBLE: 1 Corinthians 13:13 JMNT
        “For these three things are abiding, faith, and hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.”
        LET’S TALK
        Faith, hope, and love are three great principles revealed to us in the Word. First, hope is the picture of the thing you desire, which you see afar off; it’s that flicker of light on the horizon on which you fix your gaze. Many things may try to deter you from seeing the picture, but never let it go. If, for some reason, the picture gets blurry and you don’t see it anymore, get into prayer and confession of the Word to regain that vision.
        Once you can see the picture, the next thing to do is to take action! It’s one thing to look at the picture far away, it’s another thing to take possession of it and bring it into the NOW of your life. And you do that by faith! Faith is taking possession of the picture you see afar off through your confessions. The Bible says, “NOW FAITH is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses]” (Hebrews 11:1 AMPC). Hope says, “It will be mine,” but faith says, “I have it right NOW!”
        The third of these principles is love, and according to the Bible, it’s the greatest of the three. Your hope will not disappoint you because the love of God has been shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5). Also, your walk of love secures faith in your heart, for the Bible says faith works by love (Galatians 5:6). Without love your faith would not work. Love “…binds all things together in perfect unity” (Colossians 3:14 GNB); it never fails and it’s for all time.

        Speak
        I’m not of this world; I function with the higher principles of life in Zion; the principles of faith, hope and love! My faith is perfected today as I walk in love, with hope as an anchor for my soul! And above all, I put on love and envelop myself with the love of God, which binds everything together completely in ideal harmony.

        title: `NO PUNISHMENT FOR YOU (The Lord Is Not Angry With You!)`,
        body: `TO THE BIBLE: 2 Corinthians 5:19  TLB
        “For God was in Christ, restoring the world to himself, no longer counting men’s sins against them but blotting them out. This is the wonderful message he has given us to tell others.”
        LET’S TALK
        “How can I get God to forgive me?” “What can I do to make God happy with me and love me?” Charles mused, as he watched some other students stroll happily to Church. He thought God disliked him for his bad behaviour and self-destructive habits. Thus, he never attempted to get close to any Christian or go where God was mentioned. Thankfully, the day came when he was invited for a Church meeting, where he heard the wonderful truths of God’s love for him, and he finally realised that God had never been angry with him.
        Perhaps you’ve been thinking like Charles did or you know someone who does. Well, the Bible says God was in Christ, reconciling the world—the world of sinners— to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them. “Even after all the terrible things I’ve done?” you say. Yes! The trespasses of everyone in the whole world (including yours) were laid on Jesus Christ.
        Today, no one should bear any punishment for his or her sins. Jesus already bore it all for them. Often, we unintentionally do or say the wrong things, but God has made provision for our automatic cleansing (1 John 1:7). He gave no conditions for the cleansing; so you never have to worry about unknown sins in your life.
        1 John 1:9 says, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” Thus, after you’re born again, if you do something wrong, and confess it to the Father, He’s dependable and can be trusted to forgive you and cleanse you, not only from that sin, but from all unrighteousness; isn’t that wonderful? He’s not mad at you! He paid the full penalty for all your sins, both past, present, and future!

        title: `GOD WANTS EVERYONE SAVED - (The Gospel Is God’s Only Saving Power)`,
        body: `TO THE BIBLE: Romans 1:16 CEV
        “I am proud of the good news! It is God’s powerful way of saving all people who have faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles.”
        LET’S TALK
        The salvation of every person on earth is the most important thing on God’s mind. He really cares about people, and that’s the reason He gave His Son to be crucified for the sins of the world. Jesus came to mend broken hearts, heal the sick, give hope to the downcast, strengthen the weak and transform sinners into the righteousness of God.
        2 Peter 3:9 says, “The Lord isn’t slow about keeping his promises, as some people think he is. In fact, God is patient, because he wants everyone to turn from sin and no one to be lost” (CEV). He wants to have every man, woman, boy and girl come to the knowledge of His saving power, which is the Gospel of Christ. The opening scripture says the Gospel is “…God’s powerful way of saving all people who have faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles” (Romans 1:16 CEV). In other words, God can’t rescue or help anyone without the Gospel; all of His power is wrapped up in it, and it works only for the one who believes. If you believe it, it’ll certainly work for you!
        The word “salvation” is a big one! It’s the all-inclusive singular term that expresses everything that Christ did for us. Simply put, to be saved means that you’ve received eternal-life, the all-conquering life of God! No longer are you subject to satan’s authority; you’re free from sickness, disease, infirmity or any form of bondage. Therefore, no matter what you’re involved in, let soul winning be your passion. Identify your place wherever you are and reach out to those in your sphere of contact. Remember, the Gospel is God’s only saving power.
